directory-lister
================

Traverses a directory hierarchy depth first, and outputs a preorder traversal using self implemented stacks, queues, and linked lists.

To test, unzip the test data to your root folder and run the DirectoryListerDriver.  In the DirecortoryListerDriver the default root directory is C, but change it to whatever drive you need.

Console output:
